V0.59 - initial commit to git. 

	Honour panel transparency and background settings
	Pin and unpin apps to the dock
	Rearrange application icons on the dock
	Works when panel is aligned to any side of the screen
	Launch apps by clicking on their icons in the dock
	Minimize/unminimize running app windows by clicking the app's dock
	icon
	Detect changes in the current icon theme and update the dock
	accordinly
	Use an indicator by each app to show when it is running
	Allow the user to specify whether a light or dark indicator is used so
	that it can always be seen no matter what colour the panel is
	Provide an About dialog

V0.60 - various bugfixes and minor additions including:

	Added an option in the preferences dialog to display multiple
	indicators for each open window an app has. The maximum number
	of indicators has been limited to 4 because on small panels
	(<32 pixels) there just isn't room for any more
	changed the app icon drawing code so that most drawing is
	done off screen and only copied to the panel at the very
	end
	Improved detection of app icons and app windows. In general
	this is a good thing, and in particular it means that the
	applet now works correctly with guvcview on Ubuntu Mate 
	15.04
	Fixed a bug on Ubuntu Mate 15.04 where terminals started
	from the applet would have their working directory set
	as / instead of the home directory
	Updated the readme with instructions on how to compile the
	applet from source

V0.61   improved the way in which the windows owned by apps are
	detected
	Fixed the function that calculates the average colour of
	icons (for use when drawing highligts on the dock). It 
	works now....
	Fixed launching of Caja on linux mint
	Fixed docked_app.setup_from_wnck so that it passes '/' terminated
	versions of all directories to be searched for .desktop file
	to get_desktop_from_app_info
	Shift-clicking the icon of running applications now opens a new
	window of the app
	Added an option for the dock to only display unpinned apps from the
	current workspace.Pinned apps are always displayed no matter what
	workspace is active so that the user always has quick access to them)

V0.62	Fixed app icon drawing on non-composited displays.
	For apps which the applet does not recognise (their names or icons
	are incorrect) added a new right click menu option on the dock
	to create a custom launcher for the app. This displays a dialog
	(like the one for the MATE panel) allowing the app's command line,
	name, and icon to be specified. For user convenience, the applet will 
	automatically fill in as many of these details as it can. Once 
	the new launcher has been created, the app needs to be closed and
	reopened for it to be recognised by the dock. Typically, this 
	option will only be needed for apps which have not been installed
	into the usual locations within the Linux filesystem. 
	When an app's windows are minimised by clicking on the app's dock
	icon and then maximised by clicking it again, the app window that
	was previously active is made active again.

V0.63   Removed the tooltip that appears when the mouse hovers over a docked
	app and replaced it with a list of the app's open windows. For
	each window, the list displays the app icon, an indicator showing which 
	window is currently active, the window title, and a close icon.
	Clicking the close icon closes the window, clicking anywhere else
	makes the window active.
	Removed the list of app windows from the applet right click menu as
	they are no longer required.
	Changed the way the applet works when a running app's dock icon is
	clicked. This no longer minimizes/maximises all windows, but simply
	activates the app's last active window.
	Using the mouse scroll wheel over a running app's dock icon now 
	scrolls through each of the app's open windows, unminimizing them
	and activating them as necessary
	.desktop files located in the user's home directory now take
	precedence over those located elsewhere in the filesystem. This allows
	users to create their own .desktop files (e.g. to customize an app's icon)
	and have them recognized by the applet
	Changed factory service file to explicitly invoke applet with python 3
	The applet now saves its settings in ~/.config/mate_dock_applet.conf
	as well as in dconf. On first being added to a panel, the applet
	checks to see if this file exists and if it does it offers to use this
	configuration. This allows e.g. an easy way to restore the applet
	after an accidental deletion from the panel, and also a way to move
	applet configurations from one computer to another.

V0.64   Fixed bug that would sometimes prevent a window from being focused
	when a dock icon was clicked
	Many changes to Improve detection of .desktop files from running apps
	and linking to dock icons
	Right click options (e.g. 'Open new Window' and Open new incognito
	window with Chrome) are now read from .desktop files and appear on
	the dock icon right click menu
	Custom launchers now set the Type field of the .desktop files they 
	create to 'Application' and also set the NoDisplay field to 'true' 
	so that the launcher is not displayed in the MATE menu
	Customer launchers now write .desktop files that do not contain spaces
	in the filename, as per the GNOME developer docs
	App icons can now be sourced from ~/.local/share/icons (e.g
	popcorn-time puts its icon here)
	
V0.65	Dock icons now blink when an app needs attention
	Change to window activation code so that the applet works
	with MATE 1.12

V0.66	Improved matching of apps with their .desktop files, in particular
	Opera and Chrome
	Dock icons now pulse when a new window is opened for a running app
	Minimize targets are now recalculated when the applet is moved or
	changes panel, so that windows always minimize to the correct place
	on the dock
	Added option to change MATE panel colour according to the current
	desktop wallpaper. (Note: this works for images only, not slideshows,
	gradients, or solid colour backgrounds). The colour can be applied to 
	all panels or just the panel containing the dock. The applet now depends
	on the Python Imaging Library and SciPy packages because of this
	change
	Added new preferences to options to both activate panel colour changing 
	and to limit it to the dock panel panel only
	Added option to not display indicators under running apps
	Added option to not display in the dock running pinned apps which are 
	not on the current workspace
	Using the mouse wheel on a dock icon to scroll through an app's
	windows will now change workspace if the new window is not on the 
	current workspace
	Selecting an app's window from the pop-up window list will now change
	workspace if the window is not on the current workspace
	Prefs dialog reworked because of new options added in this version

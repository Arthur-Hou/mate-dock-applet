V0.59 - initial commit to git. 

	Honour panel transparency and background settings
	Pin and unpin apps to the dock
	Rearrange application icons on the dock
	Works when panel is aligned to any side of the screen
	Launch apps by clicking on their icons in the dock
	Minimize/unminimize running app windows by clicking the app's dock
	icon
	Detect changes in the current icon theme and update the dock
	accordinly
	Use an indicator by each app to show when it is running
	Allow the user to specify whether a light or dark indicator is used so
	that it can always be seen no matter what colour the panel is
	Provide an About dialog

V0.60 - various bugfixes and minor additions including:

	Added an option in the preferences dialog to display multiple
	indicators for each open window an app has. The maximum number
	of indicators has been limited to 4 because on small panels
	(<32 pixels) there just isn't room for any more
	changed the app icon drawing code so that most drawing is
	done off screen and only copied to the panel at the very
	end
	Improved detection of app icons and app windows. In general
	this is a good thing, and in particular it means that the
	applet now works correctly with guvcview on Ubuntu Mate 
	15.04
	Fixed a bug on Ubuntu Mate 15.04 where terminals started
	from the applet would have their working directory set
	as / instead of the home directory
	Updated the readme with instructions on how to compile the
	applet from source

V0.61   improved the way in which the windows owned by apps are
	detected
	Fixed the function that calculates the average colour of
	icons (for use when drawing highligts on the dock). It 
	works now....
	Fixed launching of Caja on linux mint
	Fixed docked_app.setup_from_wnck so that it passes '/' terminated
	versions of all directories to be searched for .desktop file
	to get_desktop_from_app_info
	Shift-clicking the icon of running applications now opens a new
	window of the app
	Added an option for the dock to only display unpinned apps from the
	current workspace.Pinned apps are always displayed no matter what
	workspace is active so that the user always has quick access to them)

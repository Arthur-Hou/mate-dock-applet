8 Jan 2016  - V0.66 uploaded to github
               This new version adds a feature shamlessly copied from the Unity
               Desktop - the ability of the applet to change the color of MATE
               panels to (hopefully) match the current desktop wallpaper. The 
               change can be applied to all panels or just the panel containing 
               the dock.
               As a result of this new feature, the applet has two new 
               dependencies, the Python Imaging Library and SciPy. On Arch Linux
               they can be installed with:
                    sudo pacman -S python-pillow python-scipy
               Whereas on Ubuntu 15.10 they can be installed with:
                    sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-scipy
               For other distributions the commands and package names will obviously
               vary. 
               The new version also contains a couple of minor new features and a few
               bugfixes. Full details are in the Changelog.
